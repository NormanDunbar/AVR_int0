Attach an LED to Arduino pin D13, AVR pin PB5
and toggle it in the loop.

Another LED on Arduino pin D3, AVR pin PD3, will be
toggled when a switch is pressed. The switch
MUST be attached to Arduino pin D2, AVR pin PD2.

For the sake of this test, debouncing is not used so
some flickering is to be expected. (Use long presses!)
